# What’s Cooking Kaggle Competition

This project is based on the What’s Cooking? competition on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to predict the cuisine of a recipe based only on its list of ingredients. The dataset comes from Yummly and includes recipes labeled with one of 20 different cuisines, such as Italian, Mexican, Indian, and Chinese.

This is a multiclass classification problem where the ingredient lists are treated as text data and converted into features for modeling. The main challenge is handling the high-dimensional and sparse nature of the ingredient data while accurately distinguishing between similar cuisines.

Using feature engineering on the ingredient lists and a classification model, my final submission achieved a Kaggle score of 0.72747.
